I have set up a basic Router. A Router is a component that uses the address url
past the domain name to display content on a page. (After https://somewebsite.com/)
the last slash in that domain is where the router takes over. The router will display
a specific react component based on that url route. So, .com/home could display a 
homepage, .com/profile could display a user profile. We will get into securing
our router later so that not anyone can access a users profile page.

Im also setting up a basic homepage. This is what is called a React Component.
Essentially what a react component is is a typescript function that returns html
elements. These elements are then loaded onto your webpage as an actual viewable
piece. You can see tailwind being used in the "ClassName" variable of the JSX
components (the <SomeComponent> parts of the return statement, its basically just
html syntax in typescript). All of the w-10 or h-12 or bg-blue are shorthand notation
for css documents. All the available classes can be found at tailwindcss.com, look
at it. You can also create your own classes (look up how to do that).

Remember you can view all parts of the webpage by doing "yarn dev"
